# Surrounder

[![Build](https://github.com/madskristensen/Surrounder/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/madskristensen/Surrounder/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

Download this extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace][marketplace]
or get the [CI build][vsixgallery].

--------------------------------------

This extension makes it easy to surround the selected text with either quote- or brace pairs.

Simply select some text and then hit they regular key for a quotation mark or brace. That will automatically insert the closing quote/brace at the end of the selection.

## How can I help?
If you enjoy using the extension, please give it a ★★★★★ rating on the [Visual Studio Marketplace][marketplace].

Should you encounter bugs or if you have feature requests, head on over to the [GitHub repo][repo] to open an issue if one doesn't already exist.

Pull requests are also very welcome, since I can't always get around to fixing all bugs myself. This is a personal passion project, so my time is limited.

Another way to help out is to [sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/madskristensen).
